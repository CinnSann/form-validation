# Javascript play - Form Validation
## This project solves the problem of having empty values in a form by adding validation to those empty fields that alert the user to fill them in.

In this project I was able to experience running yarn and using it run the tailwind build command. This allowed me to add custom css to my form in javascript. This form validation repo can be used to explore conditionals. For example:

    // conditionals 
    
    if (usernameValue === "" ) { 
        // what should happen 
        console.log('Please enter your username!')

        alert("Please enter your username")
